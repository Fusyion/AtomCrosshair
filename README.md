# AtomCrosshair

This addon adds a customisable crosshair to the middle of your UI. It's meant to replace the popular combat WeakAura with the same functionality.

## Features
Customisable:
- Always or during combat only
- Size
- Thickness
- Border
- Colour
- Position (X/Y)

## Notes
The reason this addon exists is because I am missing the functionality from the WeakAura. Even though I am a software developer, I have no WoW addon experience, and so this addon was developed with the assistance of AI. Expect bugs!
